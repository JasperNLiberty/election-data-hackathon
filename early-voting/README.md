Election officials may not report early voting statistics. "I attempt to collect as much of the information about these ballots as possible. However, I do not hound election officials for these statistics because they are busy doing the important work of preparing for the upcoming election. Sometimes data will be available only at the local level. I cannot continuously scan for local data, so I appreciate tips on where to find data."

Some states may report early voting statistics by party registration (if a state has party registration), race, gender, and age. "It is important to understand breakdowns of early voters by party registration are not votes. We do not know who a person registered with a party voted for. Early votes are tabulated on Election Day or after, depending if a state accepts mail ballots postmarked on Election Day. That said, we might infer that a person registered with a party is likely to support their party's presidential nominee."
