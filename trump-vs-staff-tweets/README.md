# Trump vs Staff Tweets

This dataset provides recent tweets from the [@realDonaldTrump](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump) Twitter account, collected by David Robinson.  He provides an overview of his analysis below:

"My analysis concludes that the Android and iPhone tweets are clearly from different people, posting during different times of day and using hashtags, links, and retweets in distinct ways. Whatâ€™s more, we can see that the Android tweets are angrier and more negative, while the iPhone tweets tend to be benign announcements and pictures."
