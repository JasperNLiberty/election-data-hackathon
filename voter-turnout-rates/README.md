# Voter Turnout Rates

Among the most widely sited surveys is the Census Bureau's Current Population Survey, November Voting and Registration Supplement (or CPS for short). The CPS is a large survey primarily used to calculate the nation's unemployment rate. The CPS surveys non-institutional households, which excludes from the sample military barracks, dorms and prisons. In the November of an election year the Census Bureau asks a limited number of questions about voting and registration. When cross-tabulated with the survey's extensive demographics, the CPS provides a comprehensive snapshot of participation among various demographic groups.
